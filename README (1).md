# Data Professional Survey Dashboard

This Power BI project is based on a full walkthrough from Alex The Analystâ€™s YouTube channel. I followed his tutorial to build this dashboard as a way to improve my skills in data visualization, Power BI, and basic data analysis.

## About the Project

The dashboard breaks down insights from a survey of over 500 data professionals. It covers salary comparisons, preferred programming languages, happiness ratings, and other demographic-related data points.

The goal was to take raw survey data and turn it into a clean, interactive report that gives viewers a quick overview of key metrics about the data industry.

## Tools Used

- Power BI for dashboard creation
- Excel for data cleaning and preparation
- DAX for simple calculations and measures

## Key Features

### Page 1: Overview
- Total of 504 survey respondents
- Average age of participants: 29.89 years
- Salary breakdown by job title (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.)
- Favorite programming languages (Python is the most common)
- Salary satisfaction and work-life balance scores
- Gender-based salary comparison
- Country distribution of respondents

### Page 2: Deep Dive
- Salary comparison based on education level
- Industry breakdown by role
- Happiness ratings with coworkers and management
- Percentage of time spent by gender

## What I Learned

- How to structure a multi-page Power BI report
- How to use slicers and filters effectively
- How to apply DAX for basic calculations
- How to tell a visual story using real-world survey data


## ðŸ“Œ Insights and Recommendations

### Key Insights:
- **Python is dominant** as the favorite programming language across all roles, confirming its central role in the data field.
- **Data Scientists earn the highest average salary** ($94.68K), followed by Data Engineers, indicating higher compensation for more technical roles.
- **Most respondents are from the United States**, showing a strong presence of data professionals in North America.
- **Female professionals earn slightly more on average** than their male counterparts in this dataset, although participation was lower (35% female).
- **Satisfaction with salary is low (4.26/10)** compared to happiness with coworkers (5.89) and work-life balance (5.72), indicating pay expectations may not be fully met.
- **Masterâ€™s and Bachelorâ€™s degree holders dominate the field**, especially in higher-paying roles.

### Recommendations:
- **Aspiring data professionals should consider learning Python** as a foundational skill due to its high demand across roles.
- **Those looking to maximize earnings may want to explore paths toward becoming a Data Scientist** or Data Engineer.
- **Companies should investigate reasons for low salary satisfaction**, especially among younger professionals with strong technical skills.
- **Encourage gender diversity** in data roles by creating more inclusive hiring and training pipelines.
- **Education-focused recruiting** (Bachelorâ€™s/Masterâ€™s level) aligns with most current professionals, but alternative paths (e.g., bootcamps) may help fill demand gaps.
