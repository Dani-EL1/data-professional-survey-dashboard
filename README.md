# Data Professional Survey Dashboard
This Power BI project is based on a full walkthrough from Alex The Analystâ€™s YouTube channel. I followed his tutorial to build this dashboard as a way to improve my skills in data visualization, Power BI, and basic data analysis.
## About the Project
The dashboard breaks down insights from a survey of over 500 data professionals. It covers salary comparisons, preferred programming languages, happiness ratings, and other demographic-related data points.
The goal was to take raw survey data and turn it into a clean, interactive report that gives viewers a quick overview of key metrics about the data industry.
## Tools Used
- Power BI for dashboard creation - Excel for data cleaning and preparation - DAX for simple calculations and measures
## Key Features
### Page 1: Overview - Total of 504 survey respondents - Average age of participants: 29.89 years - Salary breakdown by job title (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.) - Favorite programming languages (Python is the most common) - Salary satisfaction and work-life balance scores - Gender-based salary comparison - Country distribution of respondents
### Page 2: Deep Dive
- Salary comparison based on education level - Industry breakdown by role - Happiness ratings with coworkers and management - Percentage of time spent by gender
## What I Learned
- How to structure a multi-page Power BI report - How to use slicers and filters effectively - How to apply DAX for basic calculations - How to tell a visual story using real-world survey data
